# Android System Development On The Cloud
This curates guides, code labs &amp; resources to learn Android System Development on the Cloud.
So that, anyone can learn all aspects of A system development by building an OS, an app framework & devices on a browser from anywhere.

1. Why [AOSP](https://source.android.com/)?
  - Because the full stack of A system empowers the permissionless innovation for anyone.
2. Why Android Virtual Device?
  - Because a high fidelity emulation tool removes HW barriers for rapid prototyping, fast iteration, easier automation & work from anywhere. A good way to leverage [the power of SoftWare-Defined](https://samlin001.medium.com/the-new-age-of-software-defined-2ae97c6d3281).
3. Why the Cloud?
  - Because it lowers the entry batter as only a browser needed to get started & easy to scale multiple development setups or a big development team quicker.

## Code Labs
1. [Set Up A System Development Environment on The Cloud](codelab1/README.md).
2. [Build An Android Virtual Device On The Cloud](codelab2/README.md).
3. [Create Your Own AVD On The Cloud](codelab3/README.md).
