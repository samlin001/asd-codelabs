# Android System Development On The Cloud
## tl;dr How may we level the playing field to expand CS talent pipelines with better diversity & equity?

![Compute A Better Future](res/computeAFuture.png)

- [ASD code labs](codelabs.md) are developed as a workshop for
[Code Next with Google](https://codenext.withgoogle.com/). Which works with
high schoolers to cultivate the next generation of Black and Latinx tech leaders.
- We intend to develop in open continuously. So, anyone passionate about bootstrapping CS talent
pipeline in their community can leverage this.
- Any contribution is welcome. Let's make a dent in the consumer computing universe by getting more started.

## Why
- Why should we make Tech more diverse by expanding the talent pipeline?
- Why should we remove barriers for less privileged students to learn? How much more we can reach if students do not need powerful computers?
- Why may we make system development easier for anyone working from anywhere?

### Why Now
Because
- [CS-literacy is a skill in high demand](https://samlin001.medium.com/stay-open-push-forward-a64ef27c91f0).
But the talent gap is expanding fast.
- [The New Age Of Software-Defined](https://samlin001.medium.com/the-new-age-of-software-defined-2ae97c6d3281)
is just getting started. More opportunities & magics when hardware problems become software problems.

## How
- Coaches from Tech. to share their CS journeys to share what's like to work in
Tech. & be a role model to inspire high schoolers.
- Introduction to Computer System 101 to show how theories power our digital lives.
- Practical code labs to build Android Virtual Device on Google Cloud Platform
for a taste of [the next-generation development workflows](https://medium.com/geekculture/wwdc21-minority-report-ac4b531a0035)
& a bit of hands-on satisfaction.

## Key Outcomes
- Set up a developer machine on the cloud by a Browser anywhere.
- Build an Android Phone on the cloud.
- Create & customize your Android Phone on the cloud.

## Agenda
A typical workshop can be planned as:
- 30min. Meet Coaches
- 30min. CS 101: [Android System Development on the Cloud - Community Edition](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VY97M7SKG1KmUrRPY_Prvegw_LwZq1hd9Z8p9vTzxK8)
- 40min. Code Lab 1: [Set Up Android System Development Environment on Google Cloud](https://github.com/samlin001/asd-codelabs/tree/main/codelab1)
- 40min. Code Lab 2: [Build An Android Virtual Device On Google Cloud](https://github.com/samlin001/asd-codelabs/tree/main/codelab2)
- 40min. Code Lab 3:[Create Your Own AVD On The Cloud](https://github.com/samlin001/asd-codelabs/tree/main/codelab3)
- Do more Code Labs if there is time, or set up students to keep learning on their own. 

You can also plan a minimal workshop for 2 hours. Because students should be
able to complete the rest code labs on their own after that.

## What do students need to join the workshop?
- Ready to join [Google Meet meeting](https://apps.google.com/meet/).
- Ready to [Get started for free](https://cloud.google.com/pricing) for Google
Cloud Platform.
- Curious to learn & interested to explore next-generation computing system
development on the cloud.
