# Android System Development On The Cloud
## tl;dr How may we level the playing field to expand CS talent pipelines easier with the augmentation of GenAI ðŸ¦¾?

![Compute A Better Future](res/computeAFuture.png)

- [ASD code labs](codelabs.md) were initially developed as a workshop in 2022 for
[Code Next with Google](https://codenext.withgoogle.com/) to cultivate more Black
and Latinx high schoolers to be the next generation of tech leaders.
- We intend to develop in open continuously. So, it's easier for anyone to
bootstrap the CS talent pipeline in their communities.
- Any contribution is welcome. Let's make a dent in the consumer computing
universe by getting more people to get started.

## Why
A few questions may help to find your own why.
- Why should we make Tech more diverse by expanding the talent pipeline?
- Why should we remove barriers to make it easier for more students to learn?
- How many more we can reach if students can get started from a browser?
- Why may we make computer system development easier for anyone working from anywhere?
- How may GenAI flip the DevFlow and flattening the learning curve for beginner to
shorten their time to problem solving?

### Why Now
- [The beginning of the end of handcrafted programming because AI SW engineers are comeing](https://samlin001.medium.com/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-handcrafted-programming-maybe-e00e020e9b7a)
- [CS-literacy is a skill in high demand](https://samlin001.medium.com/stay-open-push-forward-a64ef27c91f0).
But the talent gap is expanding fast.
- [The New Age Of Software-Defined](https://samlin001.medium.com/the-new-age-of-software-defined-2ae97c6d3281)
is just getting started. More opportunities & magics when hardware problems become software problems.

## How
- Coaches from Tech. sharing how they get started their careers, what's exciting
in their fields now, and be a role model to inspire high schoolers.
- Introduction to Computer System 101 to show how theories powering our digital lives.
- Practical code labs to build Android Virtual Device on Google Cloud Platform
for a taste of [the next-generation development workflows](https://medium.com/geekculture/wwdc21-minority-report-ac4b531a0035)
to get out with hands-on achievements.

## Key Outcomes
- Set up a developer machine on the cloud to develop via a Browser anywhere.
- Build an Android Virtual Devices (AVD) on the cloud.
- Create & customize their own AVD on the cloud.

## Agenda
A typical workshop can be planned as:
- 30min. Meet Coaches
- 30min. CS 101: [Android System Development on the Cloud - Community Edition](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VY97M7SKG1KmUrRPY_Prvegw_LwZq1hd9Z8p9vTzxK8)
- 40min. Code Lab 1: [Set Up Android System Development Environment on Google Cloud](https://github.com/samlin001/asd-codelabs/tree/main/codelab1)
- 40min. Code Lab 2: [Build An Android Virtual Device On Google Cloud](https://github.com/samlin001/asd-codelabs/tree/main/codelab2)
- 40min. Code Lab 3:[Create Your Own AVD On The Cloud](https://github.com/samlin001/asd-codelabs/tree/main/codelab3)
- Do more Code Labs if there is time, and motivate students to keep learning on their own.

### A bootcamp style
You can also plan a minimal workshop for 2 hours. Because students should be
able to complete the rest code labs on their own after that.

## What do students need to join the workshop?
- Ready to join [Google Meet meeting](https://apps.google.com/meet/).
- Ready to [Get started for free](https://cloud.google.com/pricing) for Google
Cloud Platform.
- Curious to learn & interested to explore next-generation computing system
development on the cloud.
